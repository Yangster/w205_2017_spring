I correlated the average and median star ratings each hospital received from patient 
surveys against the mean normalized score and the standard deviation of the normalized scores
for each hospital.

Stars were the most effective summary of patient satisfaction as they are a general indicator
of patient sentiment. More granular numbers run the risk of adding precision where none
should exist

I found a positive relation between results of patient surveys and score and negative
between the surveys and variance of scores. This relationships are worth exploring further
but not substitute for proper regression.
