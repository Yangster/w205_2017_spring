I determined Normalized score by subtracting the national average score from the hospital 
score and dividing by standard deviation for the measure. If the measure's description 
said that 'lower ... is... better', then I took the multiplied the result by negative one.
If the description said higher was better, then I kept the result the same.
 Otherwise, the normalized score was NULL

I then averaged the normalized scores across every measure for each hospital to determine 
the ten best. I used this method as I felt it was the best way to to come up with a single,
scalar value to quantify every hospital's score. I compared it's score in every measure to 
the national average and standard deviation and took the average of every score

One of the main weaknesses of this method is that it doesn't include any non-numeric or missing
values. 

On top the usual perils of combining vector of measures into a single scalar quantity, I
weighted all of the measures evenly. This may not be the best approach. Perhaps it is more
important for a hospital to be good at bypass surgery than it is for it to be good at
treating the common cold.
